# January 26 [16:00-16:30] 
## Meeting Agenda 
1. Self introduction
2. Group meeting introduction
3. Research idea discussion
4. Q&A

## Meeting Notes 
1. Self Introduction 

2. Team meeting
- Prepare the meeting, Have something want to talk about 
- Set Agenda, meeting minutes 
- Using the Github
    - Github setup
    - Documentation on Github 

3. Meeting agenda
- Need to be set before each meeting
- Things we completed 
- Things we want to walk about

4. Dataset and project ideas
- Finding the dataset --> be aware: enough metadata for us to use?
- Find papers --> 16S, metadata,datasets available
- Send the papers to Evelyn by ❗Friday❗

5. Project ideas
1) MS and Parkinson
- A novel field
- but have been touched a lot 
2) IBD
- CD --> hard to find something novel
- UC --> novel research question is hard to find
3) infant --> datasets: need more time points, antibiotic exposure (use or not)
- how does the antibiotic exposure affect the infant microbiota --> time dependent manner
- Difficulty: Approperiate datasets 
4) Gut microbiota after chemotherapy (Novel)  --> Having datasets and paper now
5) Different types of cancers affect microbiota 

6. Combining datasets
- difficult at the beginning
e.g. Compare different cancers --> different types of cancers affect microbiota 

## To-do List 
1. Do more research on finding the relevant papers which containing 16S sequencing data and metadata
2. Get the paper ready by 6PM on Wednesday, Jan 28, 2026. 
3. Papers will be sent to Evelyn after 6PM on Wednesday, Jan 28, 2026. (once papers are finalized)
4. After hearing back from Evelyn, determine the research topic
